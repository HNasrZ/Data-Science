# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains the large real-world scale data science projects I did. For each project, an extensive effort was made to clean the data and prepare it for the analysis. Furthermore, an extensive explorarory data analysis was performed to get familiar with the data and understand some relations and trends in the data. Next, several estimators were applied to the dataset and their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and error, was measured and compared. Moreover, some boosting methods, such as random forest and gradient boosting were implemented to improve the performance of the model. As well, some feature engieering and feature selection techniques were employed to enhance the performance the model. In addition, some dimensionality reduction techniques were used to reduce the dimension of the problem, particualty for NLP project, which we had thosands of features. Finally, the best estimator and the highest achieved perforamnce were reported.
